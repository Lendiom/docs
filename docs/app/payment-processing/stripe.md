## Introduction
Lendiom initially partnered with **Stripe** for payment processing due to its ease of integration. However, as of **Q4 2023**, Stripe is no longer accepting new Lendiom merchants. Existing customers are also subject to new requirements to continue processing payments.

To ensure uninterrupted payment processing, we strongly recommend migrating to **PayArc**, our new preferred payment processor.

:::warning
Stripe support will end in **2025**. Please migrate to PayArc as soon as possible to avoid service disruptions.

## Stripe Fees
Stripe charges the following fees for payment processing:
- **Card Transactions**: 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction
- **ACH Transactions**: 1.4%

## Migrating Away from Stripe
Migrating from Stripe to PayArc is straightforward but requires careful coordination. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth transition.

### Steps to Migrate

     > Cards and ACH
   - **File Format**:

     > Full
   - **Additional Information**:  
     > GPG public encryption key is located here: [PayArc Public Encryption Key](https://docs.payarc.net/docs/pgp-key)

2. **Onboard with PayArc**  
   Complete the [PayArc onboarding process](onboarding-payarc) to set up your new payment processing account.

3. **Confirm Export with Stripe**  
   - Stripe will email you to confirm your request for a data export. Respond promptly to approve the export.

   - Stripe may request additional confirmation about your data migration. Review and confirm the details they provide.

5. **Send Encrypted Message to PayArc**  
   - Stripe will send an email with an encrypted message containing your data. Forward this email to:
     - **Primary Recipient**: `support@payarc.com`
