## Introduction
Beginning in Q4 of 2023, Lendiom integrated with a new payment processor. After doing research and talking with several different processors, we settled on PayArc to be the processor of choice moving forward. We had several reasons for switching processors, including, but not limited to, their support and understanding of our product and our customers (you, the land or rental owner). Additionally, we wanted to work with a processor that we could easily call and get human support. Plus, with their fee structures, we are able to offer lower processing rates than previous.

## Fees
The fees with PayArc vary from merchant to merchant, however, they will be no more than:
* Card fees: 3.4%
* ACH fees: 1.0%

To find out what your processing rates are, please visit the PayArc information page inside of Lendiom.
