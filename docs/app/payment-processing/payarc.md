## Introduction
Beginning in Q4 of 2023, Lendiom integrated with a new payment processor. After doing research and talking with several different processors, we settled on PayArc to be the processor of choice moving forward. We had several reasons for switching processors, including, but not limited to, their support and understanding of our product and our customers (you, the land or rental owner). Additionally, we wanted to work with a processor that we could easily call and get human support. Plus, with their fee structures, we are able to offer lower processing rates than previous.

## Fees

The fees for using PayArc vary depending on each business. However, we can guarantee that our fees will not exceed the following rates:

* Credit Card Transactions: 3.4% + $0.35 per transaction
* ACH (Bank) Transactions: 1.0% + $0.30 per transaction

To find out your specific processing rates, please visit the PayArc information page within Lendiom.

## Monthly Fees

For credit card processing, there is a minimum monthly fee that covers various expenses such as statement generation, direct deposits, and PCI compliance. The good news is that this fee decreases as you process more
transactions. This means that the more you use our service, the lower your monthly fee will be.

Additionally, for bank (ACH) processing - which is optional - there is a minimum monthly fee of $10. Similar to credit card processing, this fee also decreases as you process more ACH transactions.
