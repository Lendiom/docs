## Introduction
In Q4 of 2023, Lendiom partnered with [PayArc](https://payarc.com/payarc-and-lendiom-forge-alliance-to-enhance-payment-solutions-for-real-estate-industry/) as our primary payment processor. This decision was based on PayArc’s strong support capabilities, deep understanding of the real estate industry, and customer-focused approach. With PayArc, Lendiom can offer lower processing rates, enhanced service, and direct access to human support for our users—landlords and property managers.

## Processing Fees

PayArc’s fees vary by business, but Lendiom guarantees that rates will not exceed the following:

- **Credit Card Transactions**: 3.4% + $0.35 per successful transaction
- **ACH (Bank) Transactions**: 1.0% + $0.30 per successful transaction

To view your specific processing rates, visit the PayArc section within the Lendiom platform.

## Monthly Fees

PayArc imposes a minimum monthly fee for both credit card and ACH processing:

### Credit Card Processing
- Covers costs such as statement generation, direct deposits, and PCI compliance.
- The fee decreases as transaction volume increases, rewarding higher usage.

### ACH (Bank) Processing
- Optional service with a minimum monthly fee of **$10**.

## PCI Compliance

Since each business operates as its own merchant, maintaining PCI compliance is your responsibility. PayArc facilitates this process by sending a **PCI Compliance Questionnaire** email via **Security Metrics**. 

### Compliance Process
1. Complete the basic questionnaire to confirm PCI compliance.
2. Call PayArc support if you need guidance—they’re available to assist.

**Important**: Using the Lendiom-PayArc integration inherently ensures PCI compliance. You just need to complete the questionnaire for verification.

### Non-Compliance Fees
Failure to complete the questionnaire will result in additional monthly charges:
- **After 60 days**: $29.95 per month.
- **After 180 days**: $49.95 per month.

We strongly recommend setting aside 30 minutes to complete the questionnaire promptly.
