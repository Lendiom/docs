This guide will walk you through the process of using the Document Signing feature, including creating templates, requesting signatures, and managing your documents. **Note:** Document Signing is an addon feature and costs an additional $20 per month to enable for your organization. It includes an unlimited amount of signatures and templates.

## Overview

The Document Signing feature allows you to:
- Upload or select a document template (PDF)
- Define who needs to sign and in what order
- Drag and drop signature and form fields onto the document
- Send signature requests to client's entities or organization members
- Track the status of each request and download signed documents or audit logs

:::tip Use again
Document templates can be reused for future sign requests, saving you time.

## 2. Creating a New Sign Request

1. Click **Add New** button in the top right area of the Documents section.
2. The Document Signing Builder will open, guiding you through three steps:

### Step 1: Upload or Select a Document

### Step 2: Who & When
- Enter a name for the sign request.
- Set a due date for when signatures are required.
- Select the client (and optionally, a related loan or rental).
- Add signers:
  - Choose between an **Entity** (e.g., client contact) or **Organization Signer** (business member).
  - For each signer, specify if they should receive notifications via email and/or SMS (requires contact info).
  - Add multiple signers and set their signing order.

  - View the status of each request (Draft, Requested, Completed, Expired, Canceled)
  - See signer details, their completion status and their magic signing code
  - Edit or delete drafts
  - Cancel active requests
  - Download the signed document or audit log after completion
  - Send reminders to signers

## 5. Managing Templates
