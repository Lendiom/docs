## Terminology

### Organization
An organization represents a business.

### Inventory

Inventory categories are:
* Land
  > Raw, unimproved property that is split up into tracts.
* Residential House
  > A residential property that has a single family house on it.
* Multifamily
  > A building that has support for multiple families renting it out.

Inventory types are:
* Finance
  > Owner financing the land or residential house
* Rental
  > Renting the residential house or multifamily building
* Other (disabled for now)

A client represents a buyer or a tenant, at a grouping level. Inside the client you will have individuals, aka entities, that represent each member of the client. If you have a family, then you have one client and multiple entities in that client.
