## Brief Description
The communication portal is an area where you can easily see conversations with your clients (buyers). Send them texts, pictures and even initiate a call from the portal.

## The Why
On October 1, 2022 Carriers started enforcing that businesses register their brands (business) and the associated campaigns for the phone numbers they are using, specifically for 10 digit long codes (aka: regular phone numbers). For more information about this specifically, please see [CTIA's Fighting Spam Page](https://fightingspam.ctia.org/). Up until now, Lendiom was using the same phone number for everything - Lendiom Pay login, upcoming payment reminders and everything else. This number was the same across all of our clients. While this worked at the start, it no longer works as the CTIA requires individual business/brands register independently.

## The What
What does this look like for you and your business? Here at Lendiom, we try to make this a seamless flow. We are working with our messaging service provider to ensure we are in compliance as a platform and that you are in compliance as our customer. **The approval process can take up to 4 weeks.**

First up, let's get some definitions out of the way.
* Brand: information about your business. Your business is your brand
* Campaign: how you will be using the phone number
* Use case: the specifics of how within the campaign
* 10DLC: 10 digit long code. Ex: `(901) 183-1838`
* A2P: Application-to-Person; software or apps sending messages to individuals
* CTIA: Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. Organization that handles registration

## The How

Upon arriving to the new *Communications* page, you will be presented with a simplified information page (which links to here). Upon clicking `Set Up`, you will begin the three step process.
1. Brand registration
1. Campaign registration
1. Number search & purchase

### Brand Registration
As the brand is your business, the CTIA requires detailed legal information. While Lendiom has most of this information already, we ask you to confirm it and update anything that is not the information registered with the government. For example, if you registered your business name in Lendiom without the `LLC` suffix, then you would ensure that is added under the `Legal Name` input. Below is a list of the information required:
* Business Type: Sole Proprietor or Private Company (for profit)
* Business Structure: Sole Proprietor, LLC, C-Corp, etc
* Brand Name: The name you are doing business as (DBA)
* Legal Name: The full legal name of the business (ex: Wilkinson Properties LLC)
* Business EIN: Employer Identification Number; not required for Sole Proprietors
* Your Full Name: Who is doing the registering
* Business Number: Your current business phone number, in case we have any questions
* Your mobile number: Sole Proprietors only, will be used for verification
* Business Email: The email address for the business
* Business Legal Address: Must not be a PO Box; we pre-populate it from the billing address

### Campaign Registration
Once you have submitted your brand information, it is time to register your campaign. There is a lot of information on the campaign registration page and all of it is read-only as we have done the heavy lifting for you. The CTIA requires specific information about how you will be using the phone number. As Lendiom's usage of the 10DLC is considered A2P (application-to-person), the campaign data must be correct to not avoid delays especially considering the approval process is currently taking up to 4 weeks!

Lendiom will submit the following campaign information on your behalf:
* Use Case: Low Volume Mixed
* Sub Use Cases: Account Notifications, Marketing, Security Alerts
* Samples: Example messages Lendiom sends out
* Out Out/In: How end users can opt out and back in to messages

:::warning

If you plan to send more than 5,000 messages a day, please [contact support](https://support.lendiom.com/help/3570878021) before you go through the registration process.

### Number Purchasing
Upon clicking `Register Campaign`, Lendiom will send off the campaign information and you will be redirected to the phone number search page.

There are a few ways to search for a number but first you must select the criteria to search, either by number or locality. We default to number, that way you can search for a vanity number. The fields are:
* Number Contains: input a number or letters; minimum of 3 and max of 7
* Area Code: which area code do you want the number to be in (must be 3 numbers)
* State: two letter abbreviation for the state
* Zip Code: the postal zip code of the number, not all zip codes have available numbers

After clicking search, if there are any available numbers, you will presented with several numbers which match your search. Feel free to keep changing what you are searching for if you want to find something specific. Once you find the number you want, click the `Select` button and it will step you through the process of purchasing the number.

Lendiom will purchase the number and then assign it to the campaign registered. You are now ready to use the messaging system!

### Approval Process
As previously mentioned, the approval process can take up to 4 weeks. However, there are some case where it will take less than that.

While pending approval, any messages sent will incur additional fees from carriers. At the moment, there is no way to know the status of your campaign without contacting support. We have to manually work with our provider to check on the status. So, [contact us](https://support.lendiom.com/help/3570878021) and we will reach out to our provider.

## The Cost
The entire campaign process does cost, here is our pricing as of July 14th, 2023. We will keep this pricing page up to date, however, if you believe it is incorrect, please [contact support and let us know](https://support.lendiom.com/help/3570878021)!

### Carrier Fees
Sadly, each carrier is charging their own fee on top of everything else. The amounts are changing all of the time, so we can not have them listed in this documentation. If you want the current carrier fee pricing, please [contact support](https://support.lendiom.com/help/3570878021) and we will get you the most up to date pricing.

## Contract Verbiage
The CTIA is very particular about "automatic opt-in" and if you do automatically opt buyers into messages, you must have consent from the buyer to do so. There can not be a "hidden" clause in your contract or Terms and Conditions. You will need the buyer to initial under the paragraph describing how Lendiom is involved and that they will be opted into messaging. The follow is only an example and is **not** legal advice!

> **Lendiom.** By initialing below, Buyer(s) consent to the processing of this contract, including personal information (ex: name, mailing address, Social Security Number, and phone number), by Lendiom. Lendiom will use Buyer(s) information to provide services, to improve its products, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The Buyer also agrees to opt-in to receive text messages, or emails, for password-less two-factor authentication login flow, payment reminders or payment status updates. The password-less flow means that you will be required to enter a code from your mobile phone when you log in to Lendiom. You can withdraw your consent anytime by contacting the Seller as set forth in paragraph 15 or by sending STOP to the number. However, withdrawing your consent will restrict your ability to use Lendiomâ€™s services.

:::warning

Please consult your attorney as the example above is **NOT** legal advice; it is only an example. The one requirement is that the buyer must initial and it is clear that they are initialing to opt-in to messages from Lendiom.

## Misc Information

### SMS Segments
While SMS seems like a basic concept, the specifics behind it are complex due to the character encoding. We are summarizing this and there is more detailed information on [Wikipedia (click here)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS#Message_size). To see segments in action, please visit this [visual calculator (https://twiliodeved.github.io/message-segment-calculator/)](https://twiliodeved.github.io/message-segment-calculator/). 

When you send an SMS message containing more than 160 characters, the message is split into smaller messages for transmission. Large messages are split into 153-character "segments" and sent individually, then re-assembled by the recipient's device. The effective character limit per segment is 153 rather than 160, because a data header must be included with each segment to ensure correct re-assembly.
