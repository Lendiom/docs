## Brief Description
The communication portal is an area where you can easily see conversations with your clients (buyers). Send them texts, pictures or even initiate a call from the portal.

## The Why
On October 1, 2022 Carriers started enforcing that businesses register their brands (business) and the associated campaigns for the phone numbers they are using, specifically for 10 digit long codes (aka: regular phone numbers). Up until now, Lendiom was using the same phone number for everything - Lendiom Pay login, upcoming payment reminders and everything else. This number was the same across all of our clients. While this worked at the start, we noticed a few use cases which could be confusing.
