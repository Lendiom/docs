## Process

In order to log into Lendiom Pay, you must first know your Account Number. Your account number is a random assortment of letters and numbers (sometimes an underscore `_` or hyphen `-`).

Visit https://pay.lendiom.com and you will be presented with the following page:
![Lendiom Pay Login Screen](/img/docs/pay/logging-in/login-screenshot.png)

Enter your account number (or paste it) and then click the **Get Code** button. You will receive a text message that contains the following message:
> Your Lendiom Pay temporary code is 510475<br></br><br></br>Do not share this code with anyone. It expires in 5 minutes.

Input that temporary code into the **Auth Code** and then click the **Sign In** button.

You are now signed in and can access your account! Here is what the screen looks like after you have signed in:

## Issues

If you have troubles signing in, please double check your account number is precisely like the one provided as casing does matter! If you think you have an incorrect account number, please contact your account manager (person you're buying or renting from) to ask for it. Lendiom Support can not assist you with account number troubles.

The auth code expires after five minutes. You will have to click the **Get Code** button again to be sent an updated code.
