title: Adding a Payment Method Guide
---

A payment method is where the money comes from whenever you make a payment. We currently support:

* Debit/Credit Cards
* Bank Accounts (we use [Plaid](https://plaid.com/why-is-plaid-involved/))

## Adding One
To start adding a payment method, please visit: https://pay.lendiom.com/payment-methods. When the page loads, you will see the following (if you have no payment methods):

### Adding a Card
Click on the **New Card** button and several inputs will appear. Here is a screenshot of it:

What you need to input is the name on the card, the card number, the expiration date and the CVC. Once you click save, the card will be saved and added to your account for future usage.

:::note Payment Processor

Your card information is securely stored with the payment processor. None of the information is saved on Lendiom Pay's server nor does it pass through our network.
