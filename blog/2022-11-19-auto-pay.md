As of today, November 19th, 2022 we are pleased to announce that automatic payments are released in a *beta* status.

Automatic payments, also known as auto draft, enable the buyer to not worry about making their payment. Once set up, auto draft will be enabled until the buyer's payment method is invalid, they cancel or they pay off their loan.

Read on for more information and screenshots!

## Organization Setup

Automatic payments first require online payments be configured and enabled, in addition to having Stripe connected. To allow customers to use Auto Draft, please go to each loan, actions and the **Online Payments** option. Once there, at the bottom there is an **Allow Auto Draft** option. Switch the option to *Yes* and then click save. The client then must enable auto draft themselves!

The following is a screenshot of the configuration of the Online Payments with auto draft allowed:

## Client Setup

:::caution Payment Method Required

Before a client can use automatic payments, they must have a payment method and it must be enabled. [Please see here for how to add a payment method](../pay/guides/adding-payment-method).

Enabling auto draft is easy inside of Lendiom Pay. To do it, go to the loan details page and click on the **More Actions** button and then click on **Enable Auto Draft**:

After clicking on that, a modal will come up asking for details about the Auto Draft. The information required is:
* Payment Method to use
* Start Date
* Payment Amount
* How to Apply Extra
* Total Amount

Here is a screenshot showing this modal:

Once you tap the blue **Schedule** button, auto draft will be enabled! It is that easy.
