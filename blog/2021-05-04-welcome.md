Today I am excited to welcome you to Lendiom!

After nearly two years of work, we have officially launched with branding. While it is still very much a work in progress, we are enthralled to put a name on it and open it up!

In this post, we will present to you what it is and some of the various terminologies behind our product.

## Lendiom

[Lendiom](https://app.lendiom.com) is the primary product and contains the vast majority of the features. The users of it are land developers, loan managers, accountants and many others.

## Lendiom Pay

[Lendiom Pay](https://pay.lendiom.com) is the client facing portal where buyers/clients can view the status of their account, their loans and manage payment methods. We built it to be as easy to use as possible. Some of the features include:

- View account details
- View active loans
- View loan details
- Manage payment methods*
- Make a payment*
- Setup recurring/automated payments*

_*these require lender to have online payments setup_
